# Hi, I'm [Lerena Holloway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lerenah/) 👋

Senior Software Engineer with 6 years building production systems — APIs, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, internal platforms. Over time, I found myself more interested in **how systems break** than just how they're built.

That curiosity is now a direction. I'm working toward the intersection of **product management and cybersecurity** — understanding the engineering decisions that create risk, the controls that reduce it, and the product thinking that makes security something teams actually ship.

I'm also building products using AI tooling, because the ability to go from idea to deployed application is now a core PM skill — and I want to be fluent in it.

## 🤖 AI-Built Products

Products I've designed and shipped using AI tooling — from concept to deployed application. These sit at the intersection of my product thinking, security domain knowledge, and ability to move fast with modern tools.

| Project | What It Does | Live |
|---|---|---|
| **[Security for PMs](https://github.com/lerenah/remix-of-personal-blog-brthrs)** | Interactive cybersecurity training app for product managers — scenario-based decisions, layered security feedback, 4 learning paths, 13 lessons | [pm-sec.netlify.app](https://pm-sec.netlify.app) |
| *More coming* | | |

**Toolchain:** Lovable · ChatGPT · Claude · GitHub · Netlify
