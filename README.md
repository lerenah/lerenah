# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lerenah/">Lerena Holloway</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 6 years of experience building and supporting production systems — APIs, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and internal platforms. Over time, I found myself more interested in how systems break than just how they’re built, which led me to focus more intentionally on security.

This repository highlights hands-on cybersecurity work I’m doing through a structured cyber range and internship-style program (Josh Madakor). The projects here focus on vulnerability management, remediation, and basic detection using realistic cloud and endpoint scenarios.

My goal is to narrow my technical focus, build deeper mastery, and bridge my software engineering background with practical security work — understanding both the engineering decisions that create risk and the controls that reduce it.
