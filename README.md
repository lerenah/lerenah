# Hi, I'm [Lerena Holloway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lerenah/) 👋

Senior Software Engineer | AI Product Security | U.S. Navy Veteran | Building products at the intersection of security and product thinking

I spent six years at Bloomberg building APIs, internal platforms, and identity infrastructure. Before that, Quality Assurance Inspector on P-3 Orion aircraft in the Navy — where I learned how small failures compound into catastrophic ones, and how to trace problems to their root cause under pressure.
That combination shapes how I think now: I care about how engineering decisions create risk, and how to make security something teams can ship without it becoming a velocity tax.

I'm actively building in two directions:

🔐 Security — hands-on vulnerability management, detection, and remediation, grounded in the engineering instincts I built at Bloomberg

🎯 Product — designing experiences that make complex technical problems legible to the people who need to act on them

Right now that means going deep on cybersecurity through hands-on projects and shipping products with AI tooling. I want to be fluent in the domains I'm curious about — not just adjacent to them.

## 🤖 AI-Built Products

Products I've designed and shipped using AI tooling — from concept to deployed application. These sit at the intersection of my product thinking, security domain knowledge, and ability to move fast with modern tools.

| Project | What It Does | Live |
|---|---|---|
| **[Security for PMs](https://github.com/lerenah/remix-of-personal-blog-brthrs)** | Interactive cybersecurity training app for product managers — scenario-based decisions, layered security feedback, 4 learning paths, 13 lessons | [pm-sec.netlify.app](https://pm-sec.netlify.app) |
| *More coming* | | |

**Toolchain:** Lovable · ChatGPT · Claude · GitHub · Netlify
